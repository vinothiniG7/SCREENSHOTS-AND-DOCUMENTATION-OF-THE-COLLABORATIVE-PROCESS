#DESCRIPTION

## üîó Key Figma File(s)

*   **Main Design System / UI Kit:** [Link to your primary Figma Design System file, if applicable]
*   **Current Project File(s):**
    *   [Project A Name]: [Link to Figma File for Project A]
    *   [Project B Name]: [Link to Figma File for Project B]
    *   *(Add more as needed, or link to a directory/page listing active project files)*

## üöÄ Guiding Principles

*   **Communicate Clearly:** Over-communication is better than under-communication.
*   **Stay Organized:** Consistent naming and file structure are key.
*   **Embrace Components:** Utilize and contribute to shared libraries.
*   **Iterate & Document:** Version history and comments are your friends.
*   **Respect Workspaces:** Avoid unintentionally moving or deleting others' work.

## üõ†Ô∏è Collaboration Workflow

### 1. File & Page Structure
*   **Project Files:** Each major project or feature should have its own Figma file.
*   **Pages:** Use pages within a file to organize different sections, flows, or versions (e.g., `01_User Flows`, `02_Wireframes`, `03_Hi-Fi Mockups - Section A`, `04_Prototypes`, `Archive`).
*   **Naming Conventions:**
    *   **Layers/Frames:** Use clear, descriptive names (e.g., `Button/Primary/Default`, `Card/Article/With Image`).
    *   **Pages:** Prefix with numbers for order if helpful (e.g., `01_`, `02_`).
    *   **Files:** `[ProjectName]_[Feature]_[Status_vX]` (e.g., `WebApp_Dashboard_WIP_v2`).

### 2. Real-time Collaboration
*   **Awareness:** Pay attention to other collaborators' cursors and avatars in the file.
*   **"Parking Lots" / Scratchpads:** If exploring ideas that might disrupt a main layout, create a temporary "Scratchpad" frame or page.
*   **Avoid Overlapping Work (Initially):** If possible, coordinate with team members to work on different sections or components simultaneously to minimize conflicts. If working on the same element, communicate actively.

### 3. Using Comments
*   **Purpose:** Use comments for feedback, questions, and tracking to-dos.
*   **Tagging:** Use `@mention` to notify specific team members.
*   **Context:** Place comment pins directly on the relevant element or area of the design.
*   **Resolving:** Resolve comments once the feedback has been addressed or the question answered. Don't just delete them.

### 4. Version History
*   **Automatic Saves:** Figma saves versions automatically.
*   **Named Versions:** Manually save and name significant milestones (e.g., `Client Presentation R1`, `Dev Handoff - Sprint 3`) by going to `File > Save to Version History`.
*   **Reviewing Changes:** Use version history to understand changes or revert if necessary.

### 5. Components & Libraries
*   **Shared Libraries:** Utilize components from the team's shared libraries for consistency (e.g., UI Kit, Icon Library).
*   **Contributing to Libraries:** Follow the established process for proposing and adding new components or styles to shared libraries. This usually involves review and approval.
*   **Detaching Components:** Only detach components as a last resort and with a clear reason. Try to propose variations or new components to the library instead.

### 6. Design Handoff (to Developers)
*   **Ready for Dev:** Clearly mark frames or pages that are ready for development (e.g., using a specific page name prefix, or a status component).
*   **Inspect Panel:** Developers should primarily use the "Inspect" panel to get specs, assets, and code snippets.
*   **Clarity:** Ensure all layers are logically named and grouped for easier understanding by developers.
*   **Prototyping:** Use Figma's prototyping features to demonstrate flows and interactions.

### 7. Communication Channels
*   **Figma Comments:** For design-specific feedback.
*   **[Slack/Teams Channel Name]:** For general discussion, quick questions, and announcements related to design work.
*   **Regular Check-ins/Stand-ups:** To sync on progress and blockers.
